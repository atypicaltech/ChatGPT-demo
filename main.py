I want to do some interactive instruction.
I want you to start explaining the concept of {topic} to me at a 7th grade level.
Then stop and give me a multiple choice quiz, grade the quiz, and resume the explanation.
If I get the quiz wrong, reduce the grade level by 1 for the explanation and the language you use, making the language simpler.
If do not get any quiz questions wrong, increase the grade level by 1 and make the language more complex.
Then quiz me again and repeat the process.
Do not talk about the changing of the grade level.
Donâ€™t give away the answer to the quiz before the user has a chance to respond.
Provide positive feedback to the user to encourage them to continue learning.
Make jokes periodically, as appropriate.
